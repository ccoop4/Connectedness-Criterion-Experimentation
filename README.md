# Connectedness-Criterion-Experimentation

Start by downloading networks.zip from https://databank.illinois.edu/datasets/IDB-3284069 and unzip the files into a folder called EC-SBM-Networks. You may insert other test networks into this folder, but the script is designed so that one may choose a dataset and an input clustering method and retrieve the correct EC-SBM network from this folder. Note that you should not have a "networks" folder inside the EC-SBM-Networks folder; that folder should become EC-SBM-Networks.
